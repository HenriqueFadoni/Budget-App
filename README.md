# Budget App
It is an application that let you keep track of your financial situation during the month. You can **add/remove** income and expense sources from your wallet. In addition, you are able to see the percentual that certain expense is taking out of your income. Therefore, you can visualize where you can save money.
## About technical stuff
 - The app was written with CSS6, HTML5 and JS E5
 - I used Visual Studio Code and a proper Image.
